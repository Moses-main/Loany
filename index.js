// 1. *LendingClub API:* LendingClub provides a marketplace for personal loans and may offer API access for loan-related services.

// 2. *Plaid API:* Plaid offers financial services APIs, and while they don't directly provide loans, they can help with connecting to financial institutions and retrieving financial data, which may be useful in the loan application process.

// 3. *Kabbage API:* Kabbage is known for small business loans and may offer API access for loan application and processing.

// 4. *Blend API:* Blend provides a digital lending platform, and they may offer API access for integrating their services into your loan application process.
